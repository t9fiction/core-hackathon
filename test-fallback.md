# Fallback Wallet Implementation Test

## Summary
Successfully implemented fallback wallet functionality to enable browsing pools and token information without wallet connection.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Landing Page (index.tsx)
- Added fallback mode detection with `useIsFallbackMode()` hook
- Added "Browse Mode Active" banner when no wallet is connected
- Shows clear indication that users can browse without connecting

### 2. BuySellTokens Component 
- Enhanced to show comprehensive token information in browse mode
- Displays token details, pool status, and connection prompt
- Uses fallback mechanism to fetch token data without wallet connection
- Only restricts trading operations, not data viewing

### 3. DEX Page (dex.tsx)
- Updated TokenDataFetcher to use fallback mechanism
- Updated getAllDeployedTokens to use fallback for public access
- All tabs now work in browse mode with appropriate messaging

### 4. Existing Infrastructure
- The `useSmartContractRead` hook already supported fallback functionality
- Uses fallback public client when no wallet is connected
- Configured with environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_FALLBACK_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`

## How It Works

1. **Wallet Connected**: Uses user's wallet for all operations
2. **No Wallet Connected**: 
   - Uses fallback public client for read-only operations
   - Shows browse mode indicators
   - Allows viewing of all token information and pools
   - Restricts trading operations until wallet is connected

## Test Cases

### Browse Mode (No Wallet Connected)
- [x] Landing page shows tokens and pools
- [x] Browse mode banner appears
- [x] Token information is fetched and displayed
- [x] Pool status is shown
- [x] Trading operations are disabled with clear messaging
- [x] Connect wallet prompts are shown for trading

### Connected Mode
- [x] All functionality works as before
- [x] User can perform trading operations
- [x] User sees their own tokens in relevant sections

## Environment Setup Required

Ensure `.env` file has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FALLBACK_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_fallback_private_key_here
```

## Testing Steps

1. **With Wallet Connected**:
   - Navigate to `/` - should show tokens and pools
   - Navigate to `/dex` - should show all tabs working
   - Test trading functionality

2. **Without Wallet Connected**:
   - Disconnect wallet or use incognito mode
   - Navigate to `/` - should show "Browse Mode Active" banner
   - Should display tokens and pools using fallback
   - Navigate to `/dex` - marketplace tab should work
   - Trading operations should show "Connect Wallet" messages

3. **Verify Fallback Functionality**:
   - Check browser console for successful fallback reads
   - Ensure no errors when loading token data
   - Verify smooth transition between connected/disconnected states
