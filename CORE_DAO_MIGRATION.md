## Core DAO Specific Features

### Chain Configuration
- **Core DAO Mainnet**: Chain ID 1116
  - Factory: `0x6C38Fdd5263175738eA4bA775f7dC1a446fFe00F`
  - Governance: `0x9995d8A4a5E58fA9e179c00a73384dd0f78AcaDB`
  - DEX Manager: `0x795132570275CF47c2f0641e7ed36e81Fc6bF244`
  - WCORE: `0x40375c92d9faf44d2f9db9bd9ba41a3317a2404f`

- **Core DAO Testnet**: Chain ID 1114 (enabled with `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS=true`)
  - Factory: `0x9a06a11c2939278Df6f90c530aA728CAE94781ae`
  - Governance: `0xbbAF9457Cf1ba26B204B980a955B5abf0A94CAe4`
  - WCORE: `0x40375C92d9FAf44d2f9db9Bd9ba41a3317a2404f`

### Native Token
- Your application now properly uses CORE as the native token instead of ETH
- All balance displays and transactions use CORE
- WCORE is used for SushiSwap/DEX operations

## Environment Setup

1. Set up your `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. For development/testing, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS=true`
3. For production, only Core DAO mainnet will be available

## What Was Removed
- Ethereum Mainnet support
- All testnets except Core DAO Testnet
- Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism support
- Sepolia testnet support
- All related contract addresses for non-Core chains

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Configuration**: No need to manage multiple chains
2. **Focused User Experience**: Users only see Core DAO options
3. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed unused chain configurations
4. **Better Performance**: Less network switching logic
5. **Core DAO Native**: Fully optimized for Core DAO ecosystem

## Mobile Improvements
- **No Horizontal Scrolling**: Mobile tab navigation now uses a native dropdown
- **Better UX**: Familiar mobile interface patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience from mobile to desktop
- **Performance**: Improved rendering on smaller screens

Your application is now exclusively configured for Core DAO and provides a clean, focused experience for Core DAO users.
